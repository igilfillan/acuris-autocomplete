## Assumptions
AC1: implies that the search input should be matched to the 'name' prop in company.json
AC2: 'match the characters in the user input' . This in conjunction with the design which contained an initial cap in the search string, suggested that the input string should be matched in both character and case.

## Notes
* Clean, maintainable, code backed by tests (using a library of your choice)" - 
     * Test can be found in the /test directory. As this is a test, I have not been as exhaustive as I would be in a work situation. I have provided a range of test to show my approach. 
* Pragmatism - As you stipulated that it was my React capabilities that were being tested I made certain choices:
    * I decide to use create-react-app as it came with webpack bundling and Jest testing framework.  
    * I decided not to use a css-preprocessor
    * I decided to that creating a few tests for demonstrative purposes. For live code I'd normally create many more tests.
